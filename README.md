# product-management-with-react-js-redux

Small E-Commerce Application using "ReactJs" with "Redux" (Class-Component & Function-Component)

# About Application

Management between Products and Their Categories using "Json-Server" Node Package and "Redux"

# ERRORS, SOLUTIONS of INITIALS, ENV.JS FILE

Problem: You'll get errors when you try to save the product after clicking "Add Product", probably all of them due to differences between React Versions. ("Invalid hook call" error)
And 1 more there; categories couldn't be got to select before "save", but it saves the data correctly after closing the error page. (so it worked well except category saving of the product)

Solution: i'll try to solve it later after learn :)
